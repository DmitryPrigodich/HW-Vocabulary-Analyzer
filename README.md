# Homeworld Vocabulary Analyser

A simple solution created with a help of ChatGPT, to count word elements and give a statistics, made with a purpose to analyze already created words for Kushan conlang:
  - to understand what consonants and vowels are commonly used and what are rarity or not used
  - to understand what word structures are preferred in Kushan/Hiigaran language
  - to collect words using the same roots and suffixes
  - to find other similarities

Google [spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zb5Y1ee2zTvkYHdkAwAExr8cWcW0_cjyZhO1ZbHmXII/edit?usp=sharing) are used for this purpose and than converted into .CSV file.
